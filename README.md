# Saleka Noble Data Centric Development Milestone Project 

Welcome to my Data Centric Development Milestone Project! 
Hello, My name is Saleka and through this project I am would like to present to a great
accomplishment in my journey through Full-Stack web development.

# Technologies
1.HTML
2.CSS
3.Bootstrap v4.3.2
4.Javascript
5.Google Fonts
6.Jquery library
7.Python
8.Full Stack Micro Framework Flask
9.MongoDB
10.Heroku


# Features
This is a web application that allows users to store and easily 
access cocktail recipes. It is a full stack web application (frontend and backend) 
that provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality to a database 
hosted in the MongoDB Atlas platform and uses Heroku as a hosting server. 
It features a sophisticated design with a navigation menu along the top.
It contains an attractive homepage with access to the all cocktails.
A jumbotron display welcomes you to the webpage, 
followed by a plenty of delicious recipes for thier next big event, brunch, or time alone.
It also features a form submission page which the user can interact and input thier own recipes, 
add thier special glassware and remove recepies that they do not fancy.

Users can:
View Recepies: The Cocktail link and Browse Cocktail link will bring users to a plethora of cocktail recepies.
Add Recipe: A user form which you can submit your recipes with accompaning image.
Manage Glassware: View, edit or delete the of glassware works best for your cocktails. 
Recipe Detail: Once a cocktail recipe is clicked it displays the full recipe and preparation steps.

### Demo
A demo of this web application is available here.

## Features Left To Implement
The features which I would like to implement, would be to add a most recent 
cocktail recipes by time and date. Along with a favorites bar featureing the users
preferred cocktails at the top in a carousel.

# UX
My goal with ux design was to make sure that my application was as user friendly 
and easy to navigate as possible. I strived to make a user interface bright and inviting.

# Testing
This project was tested on several virtual devices through the use of browser developer tools. 
I have tested nagivation buttons and hyperlinks.  I was also able to test the CRUD functions create,update,read,delete 
while creating a relational database. The most challenging portion of the testing was centered around creating loops
to display the ingredient list and preparation steps and editing the values. The second most challenging portion was 
the additon of cocktail images that were stored locally in the application and the locations were to be stored in the
MongoDB database. 
Unresolved issues:
1.A bug that was found occurs when the user attempts to edit a cocktail, if an image is not choosen,
Jinja will throw a IsADirectoryError error. This fix has been added to the collection of improvements required.
2.If the user searches an item which is not in the database, no record will display. An improvement is to display
a message to tell the user that no record has been found.
